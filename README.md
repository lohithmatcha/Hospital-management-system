data structures using priority queue
The Hospital Management System is a software application 
designed to facilitate the efficient management of patients in 
a hospital setting. The system allows hospital staff to add new 
patients, prioritize their treatment based on the severity of 
their condition, serve patients in the order of their priority, 
and maintain a list of patients who have been added to the 
system. 
 
 This project aims to streamline the patient 
management process, ensuring that patients are attended to 
promptly and effectively, and reducing the overall 
administrative burden on hospital staff.
